Naming conventions:
All names should be descriptive enough to provide an understanding of the objects type, class functionality, and function purpose.
Class names should be capitalized camel case.
Variable and object instance names should use camel case without capitalizing the first letter.
Functions should use underscores and have no capitals when possible (i.e. class constructors can not)

Commenting:
Before each class prototype a multiline comment should contain the name of the class, a brief description of its use, and list all class members.
Before each function prototype a multiline comment should contain the name of the function, a brief description, and a list of inputs and returns.

Classes:
Each class prototype shall be contianed in a header file, and all member functions, other than getter and setter fucntions, shall be defined in a separate .ccp file.

Functions:
Any functions that are not part of a class shall be grouped in appropriate header files with other standalone function prototypes, with an accompanying .ccp file to provide function declaration.

Misc:
Curly Braces should be on the same line as the scope declaration (such as Function, namespace, etc.) that they are starting.
